After launching, the program detects all networks saved on the computer and saves them in a txt file. The file can be launched from a USB flash drive in order to extract passwords from computers en masse. 

The program saves the file by adding numbers to the name when it detects that a report with the same name already exists, so you can launch it without worrying about a save error.


Do not steal passwords from your colleagues.
